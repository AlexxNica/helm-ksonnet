# Helm KSonnet Plugin

This is an _EXPERIMENTAL_ plugin for supporting ksonnet/jsonnet for Helm charts.

The KSonnet [library](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet-lib) is highly experimental,
therefore this plugin is also experimental. Do not use it for production systems.

## Installation

```console
$ helm plugin install https://<URL>
```

## Usage

To get started, read the built-in help text:

```
$ helm help ksonnet
```
